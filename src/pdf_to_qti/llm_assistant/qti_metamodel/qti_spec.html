        - cardinality: whether the response contains one value, multiple, etc.
        - base_type: the primitive type (identifier, string, integer, float, etc.)
        - correct_response: the expected correct values (optional)
        - mapping: optional scoring rules to convert responses to numeric values

    A RubricBlock contains descriptive or explanatory text intended to guide
    learners, authors, scorers, or proctors. This content is not part of the
